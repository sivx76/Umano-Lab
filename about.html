                <p>Umano Labs is a digital health-focused research laboratory. We provide online tools and a gamification system for involving clinicians in the design process.</p>

                <p>Software engineers and product designers can form research teams under the Principal Investigator (PI) to interview clinicians, design new health IT products and pilot them in partner healthcare institutions.</p>

                <p>We have an accelerator model for crowdsourcing and rank-ordering clinician requests. The most promising ideas may be spun out into future technology vendors to develop these idea-stage concepts further and license them to other healthcare organizations.</p>

                <p>This allows as many patients to benefit as possible and provides an incentive for continued R&D and software maintenance.</p>

                <p>Umano Labs is an independent organization. We are not tied to the governance of any healthcare organization - this gives us flexibility in partnering with new institutions, hiring staff and taking the proper time to enhance our software projects before they are piloted.</p>

                <p>Formally, Umano Labs is unincorporated - but plans exist for incorporating a company. This would allow us to process incoming funds, hire staff in the future and other legal powers.</p>

                <p>Umano Labs is managed by a Principal Investigator, Benyam Alemu. He works with a team of independent researchers such as Harsh Sikka and others to decide what projects to commit to. Our PI manages the governance of Umano Labs and will guide the organizationâ€™s mission and strategy as our research continues.</p>

                <p>For now, we are focusing on projects that can be completed in 6-9 months. Extraordinarily long product timelines and theoretical research with minimal potential patient impact are discouraged.</p>

                <p>We generate ideas directly from clinician requests. We followup with in-depth user interviews to probe the problem from a clinical, operational and financial perspective as much as possible. These interviews are essential to building software and clinical workflows that are useful, intuitive and relieves unnecessary clinician effort to administer.</p>

                <p>We engage in a deep cycle of iterative design, customer development and business development as we validate each idea and shape each pilot. Our focus is on developing solutions through mockups, low-fidelity prototypes and props before architecting complex software.</p>

                <p>After a beta of project is completed, we work with a PI at each partner academic medical center to launch an IRB submission to initiate a formal clinical trial. The intent is to launch a feasibility study with the highest level of rigor, to publish clinical outcomes in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

                <p>Our patients deserve the highest level of evidence and care throughout the technology process and we intend to make sure every project undergoes significant vetting before it grows into a larger deployment.</p>

                  <li><strong>Proposals must have an applied, digital health focus.</strong> All projects must have clear clinical use cases, a proposed software approach and measurable business objectives they are targeting.</li>
                  <li>Clinical staff and IT managers are exposed to modern design principles, framing of business use cases and recruiting software engineers to kickstart a potential pilot. </li>
                  <li>The most active staff members are invited into an <strong>ongoing research group</strong> to foster further collaboration and pilots.</li>
                  <li>Outside groups such as family foundations, healthcare nonprofits and health system management <strong>can sponsor RFPs or staff hackathons to address issues they propose.</strong></li>
                  <li>This <strong>online, adhoc accelerator and research group format</strong> can be scaled to multiple academic medical centers and healthcare institutions to propose and launch a network of innovation software pilots.</li>

Umano Labs will continue to provide comprehensive support to guide each product through its commercialization process and meeting any regulatory concerns.</p>

                <p>These resources will be reinvested to hire staff engineers and interns to compensate their time for working on similar clinical projects.
