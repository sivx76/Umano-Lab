                <p>Umano Labs is a digital health-focused research laboratory. We provide online tools and a gamification system for involving clinicians in the design process.</p>

                <p>Software engineers and product designers can form research teams under the Principal Investigator (PI) to interview clinicians, design new health IT products and pilot them in partner healthcare institutions.</p>

                <p>We have an accelerator model for crowdsourcing and rank-ordering clinician requests. The most promising ideas may be spun out into future technology vendors to develop these idea-stage concepts further and license them to other healthcare organizations.</p>

                <p>This allows as many patients to benefit as possible and provides an incentive for continued R&D and software maintenance.</p>

                <p>Umano Labs is an independent organization. We are not tied to the governance of any healthcare organization - this gives us flexibility in partnering with new institutions, hiring staff and taking the proper time to enhance our software projects before they are piloted.</p>

                <p>Formally, Umano Labs is unincorporated - but plans exist for incorporating a company. This would allow us to process incoming funds, hire staff in the future and other legal powers.</p>

                <p>Umano Labs is managed by a Principal Investigator, Benyam Alemu. He works with a team of independent researchers such as Harsh Sikka and others to decide what projects to commit to. Our PI manages the governance of Umano Labs and will guide the organization’s mission and strategy as our research continues.</p>

                <p>We generate ideas directly from clinician requests. We followup with in-depth user interviews to probe the problem from a clinical, operational and financial perspective as much as possible. These interviews are essential to building software and clinical workflows that are useful, intuitive and relieves unnecessary clinician effort to administer.</p>

                <p>We engage in a deep cycle of iterative design, customer development and business development as we validate each idea and shape each pilot. Our focus is on developing solutions through mockups, low-fidelity prototypes and props before architecting complex software.</p>

                <p>After a beta of project is completed, we work with a PI at each partner academic medical center to launch an IRB submission to initiate a formal clinical trial. The intent is to launch a feasibility study with the highest level of rigor, to publish clinical outcomes in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

                <p>Our patients deserve the highest level of evidence and care throughout the technology process and we intend to make sure every project undergoes significant vetting before it grows into a larger deployment.</p>

                  <li>Clinical staff and IT managers are exposed to modern design principles, framing of business use cases and recruiting software engineers to kickstart a potential pilot. </li>
                  <li>The most active staff members are invited into an <strong>ongoing research group</strong> to foster further collaboration and pilots.</li>
                  <li>Outside groups such as family foundations, healthcare nonprofits and health system management <strong>can sponsor RFPs or staff hackathons to address issues they propose.</strong></li>
                  <li>This <strong>online, adhoc accelerator and research group format</strong> can be scaled to multiple academic medical centers and healthcare institutions to propose and launch a network of innovation software pilots.</li>

Umano Labs will continue to provide comprehensive support to guide each product through its commercialization process and meeting any regulatory concerns.</p>
